# Optimizing-City-Connectivity-Without Changing Key Distances 
 This project aims to optimize a city's transportation network while maintaining a specific distance constraint. The city consists of N key landmarks and M existing roads that connect them. Each road provides a direct connection between two landmarks, and the shortest path between any two points determines their minimum distance in terms of the number of roads. The goal of this project is to add new roads between unconnected landmarks to improve connectivity. However, a crucial restriction must be maintained: the shortest distance between landmark X (home) and landmark Y (central point) must remain unchanged. Therefore, the challenge is to identify and list all possible new roads that can be added without altering this critical distance, ensuring an improved yet structurally consistent city network.
